 Machine learning is really fascinating.
Let's say we have a very smart and hardworking person that spends majority of their time learning new stuff.
Now if another person wants to learn from them, they will have to allocate a good amount of their time to studies, which can be frustrating for majority of us humans so we can't convince everyone to follow their paths.

On the other hand, if a genius person was able to transfer information to a computer (ie: built a machine learning program, created a new algorithm...) we can transfer the results to ALL computers at a constant time, allowing us to overcome obstacles such as learning curve or motivation.


    I have watched multiple documentaries about Tesla, so I'll talk about Self driving here:
Tesla virtually trains their AI. They create a simulation with thousands of Tesla cars (with slightly different AI algorithms) that includes other cars and humans, and they run it as a way for the AI to self-learn. (virtually on the cloud). The AI will pick the best algorithm and make it standard in all cars at a constant time without having to train each car individually. 

Challenge: Statistically speaking, AI is not perfect, although Tesla's self driving algorithm is safer than the average human driver. Here is an example of an edge case situation.
  #Situation: you counter a cyclist WITH a helmet and another one WITHOUT a helmet, which one you will hit ?
  
  #Decision making: one can argue that it might be better to hit the one with the helmet (hitting the other one has a high chance that they will die). But if we applied that in all cars on a large scale, it would be preferred to not wear a helmet, as you would not be getting hit. This is one of the ethical challenges that they need to deal with
